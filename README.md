# prophet-challenge

Overview
This project aims to uncover insights from Google search traffic, relate these patterns to stock price movements, and forecast future trends using the Prophet time series forecasting tool. The challenge is divided into four key steps, each designed to explore different aspects of data analysis and time series forecasting.

Getting Started
Before diving into the analysis, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, prophet, and any other library necessary for data manipulation and visualization.

Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib prophet
Challenge Steps
Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
Objective: Identify anomalies in the hourly Google search traffic data.
Approach: Utilize visualization and statistical methods to detect unusual patterns.
Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
Objective: Analyze the data to identify seasonal patterns in Google search traffic.
Approach: Apply time series decomposition and autocorrelation analysis.
Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
Objective: Explore correlations between Google search traffic and stock price movements.
Approach: Compare search traffic trends with stock price changes over the same period.
Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet
Objective: Forecast future Google search traffic using Prophet.
Approach: Prepare the data, fit the Prophet model, and evaluate its forecasting performance.
