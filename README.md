# prophet-challenge

Overview
This project aims to uncover insights from Google search traffic, relate these patterns to stock price movements, and forecast future trends using the Prophet time series forecasting tool. The challenge is divided into four key steps, each designed to explore different aspects of data analysis and time series forecasting.

Getting Started
Before diving into the analysis, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, prophet, and any other library necessary for data manipulation and visualization.

Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib prophet
Challenge Steps
Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
Objective: Identify anomalies in the hourly Google search traffic data.
Approach: Utilize visualization and statistical methods to detect unusual patterns.
Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
Objective: Analyze the data to identify seasonal patterns in Google search traffic.
Approach: Apply time series decomposition and autocorrelation analysis.
Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
Objective: Explore correlations between Google search traffic and stock price movements.
Approach: Compare search traffic trends with stock price changes over the same period.
Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet
Objective: Forecast future Google search traffic using Prophet.
Approach: Prepare the data, fit the Prophet model, and evaluate its forecasting performance.
Data
Describe the datasets used in this project, including their sources, structure, and any preprocessing steps applied.

Results
Summarize the key findings from each step of the challenge, including any interesting patterns or correlations discovered, and the performance of the forecasting model.

Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic
Findings: Analysis revealed several spikes in search traffic that coincided with major events relevant to the search terms. For example, traffic significantly increased during product launch events or major announcements related to the search terms.
Insight: These spikes indicate that Google search traffic is highly responsive to real-world events, suggesting potential predictive or reactive value in search data for forecasting models.
Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality
Findings: The search traffic data exhibited strong weekly seasonality, with peaks typically occurring on certain days of the week, likely reflecting the pattern of public interest or activity related to the search terms.
Insight: Understanding the seasonal patterns in search data can improve forecasting accuracy by adjusting for predictable variations in search behavior over time.
Step 3: Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns
Findings: A moderate correlation was found between search traffic volume and the stock prices of companies related to the search terms. Increased search traffic often preceded a rise in stock prices by a short period.
Insight: This correlation suggests that Google search traffic might be used as an indicator for investor interest or market sentiment, potentially serving as a leading indicator for stock price movements.
Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet
Findings: The Prophet model successfully captured the underlying trend and seasonality in the search traffic data, providing forecasts with a reasonable level of accuracy.
Performance: The model's forecasts were evaluated using historical data, showing a good fit with actual observations and an acceptable range of prediction errors.
Insight: The performance of the Prophet model underscores its utility in forecasting time series data that exhibit complex patterns of seasonality and trend. The model's flexibility in handling holidays and special events further enhances its forecasting capability.
Overall Insight
The challenge highlighted the potential of using Google search traffic as a predictive tool for both market behaviors and forecasting future trends. The correlation between search traffic and stock prices, in particular, offers intriguing possibilities for financial analysis and investment strategies. Moreover, the successful application of the Prophet model demonstrates its effectiveness in time series forecasting, particularly in scenarios where data exhibit strong seasonal effects and are influenced by external events.
